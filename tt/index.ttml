        <h1>ack 2.04 is a tool like grep, optimized for programmers</h1>

        <p>
        Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous
        trees of source code, ack is written purely in
        portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of
        Perl's regular expressions.

        <h2>Top 5 reasons to use ack</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt class="fast">Blazing fast</dt>
            <dd>It's fast because it only searches the stuff it makes sense to search.</dd>

            <dt class="search">Better search</dt>
            <dd>Searches entire trees by default while ignoring Subversion, Git and other VCS directories
            and other files that aren't your source code.</dd>

            <dt class="keystrokes">Designed for code search</dt>
            <dd>Where grep is a general text search tool, ack is especially for the programmer searching source code.
            Common tasks take fewer keystrokes.</dd>

            <dt class="pc">Highly portable</dt>
            <dd>ack is pure Perl, so it easily runs on a Windows installation Perl
            (like <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>) without modifications.</dd>

            <dt class="open">Free and open</dt>
            <dd>Ack costs nothing.  It's 100% free and open source under
            <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0">Artistic License v2.0</a>.
